* Introduction to Knowledge Entry

This demonstration shows how to extend the SkinTwin knowledge base
using Org mode and the OpenCog integration.

** How Knowledge is Represented

SkinTwin uses OpenCog's AtomSpace to represent knowledge as a graph, with:
- Concepts (nodes representing entities)
- Predicates (relationships between entities)
- Inheritance links (taxonomic relationships)
- Evaluation links (applications of predicates)

Each entry can have attention values:
- STI (Short-Term Importance)
- LTI (Long-Term Importance)
- VLTI (Very Long-Term Importance)

* New Skin Condition: Rosacea

:LTI: 0.650
:VLTI: t
:END:

Rosacea is a chronic inflammatory skin condition primarily affecting the face.
It is characterized by persistent redness, visible blood vessels, and sometimes
papules and pustules.

* Instructions for Using This File

To add this knowledge to the SkinTwin system:

1. Open this file in Emacs
2. Enable SkinTwin mode with `M-x skintwin-mode`
3. Enable OpenCog Org mode with `M-x aichat-opencog-org-mode`
4. Convert the entire buffer to knowledge with `C-c o b`
5. Or convert specific headings with `C-c o k`

After adding the knowledge, you can:

1. Query treatments for rosacea with `C-c s q` and entering "rosacea"
2. Visualize the knowledge graph with `C-c s v`
3. Analyze a patient with rosacea using `C-c s a`
